### Project Objective

Cineverse is a dynamic and responsive web application for discovering movies and TV shows.

### Tools & Technologies

-   **Frontend:**
    -   **HTML5:** The core markup language used for the structure of the web page.
    -   **CSS3:** Custom styles for a dark theme and modal animations.
    -   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all dynamic features, including API calls, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
    -   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for building custom, responsive designs quickly.
-   **APIs & Data:**
    -   **The Movie Database (TMDB) API:** The primary source for all movie, TV show, cast, and image data.
-   **Development Tools:**
    -   **Visual Studio Code:** The code editor used for development.
    -   **Git:** Version control system for tracking changes.

### API Key Source

The project uses a single API key from The Movie Database (TMDB) to fetch all its content. For simplicity and ease of use in a static project, the API key is included directly in the `index.html` file.

**Note:** For production-level applications with a backend server, it is highly recommended to use environment variables (`.env`) and keep API keys on the server side to prevent them from being publicly exposed.
